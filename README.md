please note, there are additional files in this preliminary release that are unused for the software. please disregard assignment2.py (that was being used as a template for tkinter), owm_weather_test.py that is being used to test another weather api, and tests.py that was being used to test the mroservice

you MUST delete all txt files before running. then run "get_current_aqui.py", "Weather_goodinel.py", and "UI.py" in separate processes. aka open each file in pycharm, right click on each page and run for each file.
